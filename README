1. attach the keyboard to the host
2. make it visible to the VM by going to devices->select keyboard
3. after connecting, compare the output of dmesg related to the port number of the added keyboard with the bindings in /sys/bus/hid/drivers/hid-generic. This will give you the port number. For my case, it was 1-2:1.0
4. download the usbkbd.c file and place it in ~/linux-source-3.16/drivers/hid/usbhid
5. run the script make_install_hidtokbd.sh in the linux-source-3.16 folder. This script makes the usbkbd folder, installs the driver and switches from hid driver to usbkbd driver using the port number deduced in step 3.
6. The modified kbd driver is ready to be used.
